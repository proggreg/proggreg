### Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I'm Greg a Web Developer and Tech Enthusiast. <br>
I got into coding through studying Music Technology where I learnt how to create audio plugins in C++ using the JUCE Library.
Since then I have studied Computer Science and have been coding since. I played around with different programming languages and technologies which have lead me to Web Dev.
The first Framework I learnt was Vue and have been a fan ever since and now mainly use Nuxt. I have been learning React, Next.js and Remix.js recently and I want to try Solid and laravel at some point.
